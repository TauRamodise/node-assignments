inside the appointment book repository you will find;
    • index.html file – the portion that the client will see.
    • server.js file – the server will write user information into  JSON file object
    • css/visitor.css – CSS styling file
    • visitorFileID.js – JavaScript that assigns the JSON file id with the visitors name

How to begin: 

1. Clone the github repository in the terminal
2. type in command line npm install
3. Run the file with node server
4. Follow the server link to the html page
